I am using this repository to store and display a few Jupyter Notebooks.

[comed.ipynb](comed.ipynb) is an analysis of my electricity usage over a year.

[Baby votes.ipynb](Baby%20votes.ipynb) analyzes the [votes](http://allourideas.org/footebaby/) that SICSS participants made when we were trying to name our baby.
